This page collects useful resources for learning and using AI coding assistants—especially GitHub Copilot—across our frontend projects.

## Official docs

- GitHub Copilot — official documentation and getting started guides: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot
- GitHub Copilot for Business — admin and licensing details: https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/organizations

## Tutorials & Guides

- "Getting started with GitHub Copilot" — step-by-step IDE setup and first prompts (official and community tutorials).
- "Prompt engineering for developers" — short guides that explain how to craft effective prompts for code generation and tests.

## Sample prompts (copy & adapt)

- Generate a React component scaffold:

```text
Create a TypeScript React functional component named MyButton with props {label: string, onClick: () => void}. Include Tailwind classes for padding and rounded corners, and export as default. Add a short unit test using React Testing Library.
```

- Write a unit test for an Angular service:

```text
Write Jasmine unit tests for AuthService that mock HttpClient and verify login() handles success and error responses.
```

- Improve function performance with RxJS:

```text
Refactor the following RxJS pipeline to debounce input events, cancel previous requests, and share the result among subscribers. Explain each change.

```

## Security & policy

- Internal security checklist — always follow company rules for secrets, data handling, and third-party code when using AI assistants.
- Never include API keys, credentials, or proprietary code in prompts.

## Where to contribute

If you find helpful tutorials, prompt recipes, or examples, please contribute them to this repo under `contents/docs/ai/` or `contents/docs/getting-started/resources/` and open a PR referencing the relevant team.

If you want, I can add a dedicated `contents/docs/ai/prompts.mdx` with categorized prompts for React, Angular, Vue, testing, and documentation. Shall I create that file with 10 starter prompts?
