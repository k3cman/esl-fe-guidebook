## What is this guide

In order to achieve high quality Angular architecture, and prevent technical debt from being created, this guide was created to help you either setup the project from start, or to improve existing project by implementing rules and approaches to an existing project.

This guide is a set of guidelines, that aims to set best practices for all Angular projects within the company, and by that giving clients qualty, as well as giving developers tools with wich they can be more efficient while working with this framework.

> NOTE: This is not an Angular Tutorial. This document assumes you have basic understanding of Javascript, Front-end developement and Angular, along with Objective Orijented Programming and basic Design patterns used in web developement!

## How to use

The guidelines are mainly pointed towards developers who want to improve their existing application or create a new one, as well for developers wanting to learn and understand Angular and FrontEnd more.

We recommend starting from code quality section of the guide, where you can see some of the best practices used to achieve scalable systems and small tips and tricks to write less code and achieve more performant applications.

If you are in search of improving whole application architecture we recommend checking out Guidelines sections where you can find small examples and explanations on when and why should you use different approaches for solving different problems like for example state managment.

You can also check our roadmap page, where you can see paths for either starting a new application or optimizing existing one.
