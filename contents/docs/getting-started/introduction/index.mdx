## What is this guide?

To achieve high-quality frontend architecture and prevent technical debt, this guide was created to help you either set up a project from the start or improve an existing project by implementing best practices and approaches.

This guide provides a set of guidelines aimed at establishing best practices for all frontend projects within the company, including Angular, Vue, and React. By following these guidelines, we aim to deliver high-quality solutions to our clients and equip developers with tools to work more efficiently with these frameworks. Additionally, this guide offers resources to help developers advance their technical knowledge and skills.

> NOTE: This is not a tutorial for Angular, Vue, or React. This document assumes you have a basic understanding of JavaScript, frontend development, and the respective frameworks, along with object-oriented programming and basic design patterns used in web development.

## How to use

The guidelines are primarily intended for developers who want to improve their existing applications or create new ones, as well as for those who want to learn and understand Angular, Vue, React, and general frontend development better.

We recommend starting with the code quality section of the guide, where you can find best practices for achieving scalable systems and tips for writing less code while creating more performant applications.

If you are looking to improve the overall architecture of your application, check out the Guidelines section. Here, you will find examples and explanations on when and why to use different approaches for solving various problems, such as state management.

You can also visit our roadmap page to see the paths for starting a new application or optimizing an existing one.
