# Module 1: Getting Started with GitHub Copilot

Welcome to GitHub Copilot! This guide will walk you through the first steps of setting up and understanding how we use this powerful tool at ESL.

## 1.1. What is GitHub Copilot?

Think of GitHub Copilot as your AI pair programmer. It's an AI-powered tool integrated directly into your editor that provides real-time suggestions, from single lines of code to entire functions and even unit tests.

It doesn't just autocomplete what you're typing; it understands the context of your code and generates new code to help you solve problems faster. At its core, Copilot helps reduce the time you spend on boilerplate and repetitive patterns, allowing you to focus on the more complex, creative aspects of software development.

GitHub Copilot is not here to replace your work; the best way to describe it is that it's a car and you are the driver.

## 1.2. Why We're Using It: The Core Benefits

We've adopted GitHub Copilot to help our development teams achieve several key goals:

- Accelerate Delivery: By handling repetitive tasks and generating boilerplate code, Copilot allows us to build, test, and ship features more quickly, helping us meet our project timelines.

- Improve Code Quality & Consistency: Copilot can be guided to suggest code that aligns with our internal best practices and style guides, leading to more consistent and maintainable code across all our projects.

- Easier Onboarding: When a developer joins a new project, Copilot can help them get up to speed faster by providing context-aware suggestions and explaining unfamiliar blocks of code.

## 1.3. Installation and Setup

Getting Copilot running in your editor is a straightforward process. Please follow the setup guide that corresponds to your primary Integrated Development Environment (IDE).

Visual Studio Code:

JetBrains IDEs (IntelliJ, WebStorm, etc.):

- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/17718-github-copilot
- https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/27250-copilot

## 1.4. Security & Best Practices at ESL

While Copilot is an incredibly powerful tool, it's crucial that we use it responsibly and securely. Please adhere to the following guidelines at all times.

### Code Privacy

Our company uses the GitHub Copilot Business/Enterprise plan. A key feature of this plan is that the code snippets from our repositories are not used to train the public models. Your code remains your code.

### Key Guidelines

- Never Use Copilot with Sensitive Data: Do not have files open containing PII (Personally Identifiable Information), secret keys, API tokens, passwords, or other sensitive credentials when Copilot is active. While our code isn't used for training, it's a critical security practice to avoid exposing secrets to any automated tool.

- You Are the Pilot: Always treat AI-generated code as a suggestion, not a final answer. You must review and understand every line of code that Copilot generates before committing it to our codebase. You are ultimately responsible for the code you write.

- Test Thoroughly: Just like any code you write manually, AI-generated code must be thoroughly tested to ensure it is correct, performant, and secure.

By following these initial steps and guidelines, you'll be well on your way to using GitHub Copilot effectively and safely.
