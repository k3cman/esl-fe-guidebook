#### What is the State Pattern?

The State pattern is a design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. This pattern is useful when an object’s behavior depends on its state.

#### Key Concepts of the State Pattern

1. **Context**: This is the class that contains the current state and delegates the behavior to the current state object.

2. **State**: An interface or abstract class that defines the behavior associated with a particular state.

3. **ConcreteState**: Concrete implementations of the State interface. Each ConcreteState class implements a specific behavior for the context when in that particular state.

### Why Use the State Pattern?

1. **Avoid Complex Conditional Statements**: State pattern helps eliminate complex code with massive conditionals that alter how the class behaves according to the current values of the class’s fields.

2. **Enhance Code Readability and Maintainability**: State pattern keeps the behavior related to each state modular and isolated, making it easier to modify and extend.

3. **Simplify State Transitions**: The State pattern makes it easy to manage transitions between states because each state knows how to transition to the next one.

4. **Promote Extensibility**: The system can be easily extended with new state classes and ensure it properly handles transitions to/from other states, without modifying existing code.

5. **Improve Flexibility**: The State pattern allows you to change the state dynamically at runtime.

6. **Decouple State Management from Context**: The context (or main object) doesn't need to know the details of how a state works. It just interacts with the state interface.

### JavaScript Example of the State Pattern

1. **Without State Pattern**

Let's consider a simple example where we have a `TrafficLight` class that should change state based on the currentState property.

```javascript
class TrafficLight {
  constructor() {
    this.currentState = 'RED'; // Initial state
  }

  change() {
    if (this.currentState === 'RED') {
      console.log('Red light! Now changing to green...');
      this.currentState = 'GREEN'; // Change to Green
    } else if (this.currentState === 'GREEN') {
      console.log('Green light! Now changing to yellow...');
      this.currentState = 'YELLOW'; // Change to Yellow
    } else if (this.currentState === 'YELLOW') {
      console.log('Yellow light! Now changing to red...');
      this.currentState = 'RED'; // Change to Red
    }
  }
}

// Test the TrafficLight system
const trafficLight = new TrafficLight();

trafficLight.change();  // Red -> Green
trafficLight.change();  // Green -> Yellow
trafficLight.change();  // Yellow -> Red
trafficLight.change();  // Red -> Green again
```
In this example, we have created a `TrafficLight` class with a property `currentState` and a method `change` that handles all possible state transfers. The problem is that in the future we might want `change` method to handle more states which can lead to increased code complexity and reduce code readability and maintainability.


2. **With State Pattern**

```javascript
// Abstract State class
class TrafficLightState {
  changeState(trafficLight) {
    throw new Error('This method should be overridden by subclasses');
  }
}

// Concrete State: Red light
class RedLight extends TrafficLightState {
  changeState(trafficLight) {
    console.log('Red light! Now changing to green...');
    trafficLight.setState(new GreenLight());  // Transition to Green
  }
}

// Concrete State: Green light
class GreenLight extends TrafficLightState {
  changeState(trafficLight) {
    console.log('Green light! Now changing to yellow...');
    trafficLight.setState(new YellowLight()); // Transition to Yellow
  }
}

// Concrete State: Yellow light
class YellowLight extends TrafficLightState {
  changeState(trafficLight) {
    console.log('Yellow light! Now changing to red...');
    trafficLight.setState(new RedLight()); // Transition to Red
  }
}

// Context: TrafficLight
class TrafficLight {
  constructor() {
    this.state = new RedLight();  // Initial state
  }

  setState(state) {
    this.state = state;
  }

  change() {
    this.state.changeState(this);
  }
}

// Test the TrafficLight context
const trafficLight = new TrafficLight();

trafficLight.change();  // Red -> Green
trafficLight.change();  // Green -> Yellow
trafficLight.change();  // Yellow -> Red
trafficLight.change();  // Red -> Green again
```

In this example, we have created `TrafficLightState` class that holds `changeState` which will be used by all concrete state classes. All concrete state classes are extending TrafficLightState and have their own implementation of `changeState` method. Now TrafficLight class has a reference to the current state and `change` method only delegates the state change to the current state.
