### How to contirbute to the project
Go to the repo of the project and clone to your machine.

The app is build with NextJS and MDX, some basic knowledge of markdown is needed to write documents.

The structure works in following way:
Each page is markdown document and has its own folder, the routes are built using the folders. (markdown is in contents folder)
The file placed in following manner ::root::/contents/docs/getting-started/introduction/index.mdx will result in route localhost:3000/docs/getting-started/introduction

Inside of contents folder:
Blog - keeps recipes
Docs - keeps guidebook files

After adding new document it needs to be added to routes-config.ts for guidebook documents, in order to have custom order of sidemenu links towards documents
Recipes get shown by themselves, but will be changed in the future to have filters for frameworks, problems and other params.

After completing new document or documents, contributor should submit a PR. Please do not push directly to main branch.

### Installation
Since this is nextjs template that gives us docs out of the box, npm install --force is required in order to install dependencies.
