### Intro
This page defines roadmap of writing this guidebook and its Recipes pages.


### Patterns
- [ ] Dependency Injection
- [ ] Singleton Pattern
- [ ] State managements
- [ ] Facade Pattern
- [ ] Repository Pattern

For the above group of patterns that should be described in advanced concepts, altho every engineer should know these pattenrs we should provide couple of recipes.
This list is mainly for angular as it connects angulars change detection with these patterns which are depending on the framework more fit or not, but should be written primarly for Vue as well as for Angular, later for React.

- [ ] Recipe - Use dependency injected http service with Singleton pattern and facade in order to separate http, business and ui layers.
- [ ] Recipe - Keeping state in singleton services without libraries
- [ ] Recipe - Repo -> http -> facade -> ui
- [ ] Recipe - [Angular] http -> facade with state -> ui (with async pipe)

### Microfrontends
- [ ] The article should show differences between separate implementations of microfrontends and when to implement them
- [ ] Recipe - Nx microfrontends
- [ ] Recipe - [Angular] angular-architects/module federation

### Performance
- [ ] Performance optimization
- [ ] SSR

- [ ] Recipe - Practical performance optimization of DOM, bundle size
- [ ] Recipe - Wirting proper code for your framework in order to achieve optimal performance


### Common techniques
- [ ] VirtualScroll
- [ ] Deffer loading, lazy loading
- [ ] Dictionary/HashMap
- [ ] Theming
- [ ] Route guards
- [ ] Auth
- [ ] Interceptors
- [ ] Debounce/Throttle
- [ ] Hash Table/Dictionary

Each of these should have recipe for respective framework


### Uncategorized for now
- [ ] Webpack,Vite,Rspack,bun
- [ ] TsConfig
- [ ] Containers
- [ ] Design Systems - Make design system recipe
- [ ] Tailwind
- [ ] Canvas - Charts
- [ ] NPM - making libraries
- [ ] Libraries - describe good/bad/ugly npm libraries
- [ ] Web worksers
- [ ] Service worksers
- [ ] Browser APIs - setTimeout, notification api etc
- [ ] Browser Storage
